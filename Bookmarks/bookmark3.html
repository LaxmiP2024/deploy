        The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC. One of the area's major north-south trade routes crossed the Seine on the île de la Cité, which gradually became an important trading centre.The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.

        After the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in from around the 10th century,Paris's cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville).The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris's river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris's first municipal government.
